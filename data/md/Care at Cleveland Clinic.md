**Overview**

**What** **is** **stress?**

Stress is a natural human reaction that happens to everyone. In fact,
your body is designed to experience stress and react to it. When you
experience changes or challenges (stressors), [<u>your body produces
physical
and</u>](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/things-stress-can-do-to-your-body)
[<u>mental
responses</u>.](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/things-stress-can-do-to-your-body)
That’s stress.

Stress responses help your body adjust to new situations. Stress can be
positive — keeping you alert, motivated and ready to avoid danger. For
example, if you have an important test coming up, a stress response
might help your body work harder and stay awake longer. But stress
becomes a problem when stressors continue without relief or periods of
relaxation.

**Types** **of** **stress**

There are three main kinds of stress: acute, episodic acute and chronic.

> **Acute** **stress:** Acute stress is short-term stress that comes and
> goes quickly. It can be positive or negative. It’s the feeling you get
> when you’re riding on a rollercoaster or having a fight with your
> boyfriend. Everyone experiences acute stress from time to time.
>
> **Episodic** **acute** **stress:** Episodic acute stress is when you
> experience acute stress on a regular basis. With this kind of stress,
> you don’t ever get the time you need to return to a calm, relaxed
> state. Episodic stress frequently affects people working in certain
> professions, like healthcare providers.
>
> **Chronic** **stress:** Chronic stress is long-term stress that goes
> on for weeks or months. You may experience chronic stress due to
> marriage troubles, issues at work or financial problems. It’s
> important to find ways to [<u>manage chronic
> stress</u>](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/5-ways-to-manage-stress-during-lifes-hectic-moments)
> because it can lead to health issues.

**Symptoms** **and** **Causes**

Stress can cause physical, psychological or behavioral symptoms.

**How** **does** **stress** **affect** **the** **body?**

Your body’s [<u>autonomic nervous
system</u>](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23273-autonomic-nervous-system)
controls your heart rate, breathing, vision changes and more. Its
built-in stress response — the [“<u>fight-or-flight
response</u>”](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-happens-to-your-body-during-the-fight-or-flight-response)
— helps your body face stressful situations.

When you have long-term (chronic) stress, continued activation of the
stress response causes wear and tear on your body. You may develop
stress symptoms that are physical, psychological or behavioral.

**Physical** **symptoms**

Physical symptoms of stress may include:

> Aches and pains.
>
> [<u>Chest
> pain</u>](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21209-chest-pain)
> or a feeling like your heart is racing. Exhaustion or trouble
> sleeping.
>
> [<u>Headaches</u>,](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9639-headaches)
> [<u>dizziness</u>](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/6422-dizziness)
> or shaking. [<u>High blood pressure
> (hypertension)</u>.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4314-hypertension-high-blood-pressure)
> Muscle tension or jaw clenching. Stomach or digestive problems.
>
> Trouble having sex. [<u>Weakened immune
> system</u>.](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-happens-when-your-immune-system-gets-stressed-out)

**Psychological** **symptoms**

Stress can lead to emotional and mental (psychological) symptoms, like:

> [<u>Anxiety</u>](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9536-anxiety-disorders)
> or irritability.
> [<u>Depression</u>.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9290-depression)
>
> [<u>Panic
> attacks</u>.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4451-panic-attack-panic-disorder)
> Sadness.

**Behavioral** **symptoms**

Often, people with chronic stress try different things to cope. And some
of those things are habit-forming and can have an impact on your health.
These may include:

> [<u>Alcohol use
> disorder</u>.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/3909-alcoholism)
> [<u>Gambling
> disorder</u>.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17881-gambling-disorder-gambling-addiction)
>
> [<u>Overeating</u>](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24680-overeating)
> or developing an [<u>eating
> disorder</u>.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4152-eating-disorders)
>
> [<u>Participating compulsively in
> sex</u>,](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22690-sex-addiction-hypersexuality-and-compulsive-sexual-behavior)
> shopping or internet browsing.
> [<u>Smoking</u>.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17488-smoking)
>
> [<u>Substance use
> disorder</u>.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16652-drug-addiction-substance-use-disorder-sud)

**Stress** **rash**

[<u>Stress
rashes</u>](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-am-i-breaking-out-in-hives-when-im-stressed)
often appear as pink or discolored, raised bumps called
[<u>hives</u>.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8630-hives)
Hives are welts that can develop and swell on the surface of your skin.
They can itch, burn and even hurt. Hives are usually an allergic
reaction to something, like certain kinds of foods, fabrics or
chemicals. But sometimes, stress can trigger an outbreak.

Stress rashes are more common in women and people [<u>assigned female at
birth
(AFAB)</u>](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/afab-and-amab-meaning)
than men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB), and they affect
people in their 20s, 30s and 40s most often. But they can also affect
anyone. Like other kinds of hives, you can try treating them with an
[<u>antihistamine.</u>](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/21223-antihistamines)
But it’s also important to manage your stress.

**What** **causes** **stress?**

Stress is how your body reacts to a change or challenge, and many
different things can lead to it. Stressors can also be positive or
negative. For instance, getting a new job or losing a job can both cause
stress. Other causes of stress include:

> An illness or death of a loved one. Marriage, separation or divorce.
> Financial issues.
>
> Moving to a new house. Going on vacation. Having a baby. Retiring.

Stress can also be acute, meaning short term. Causes of acute stress may
include everyday stressors, like:

> Studying for a big test.
>
> Getting ready for a work presentation.
>
> Having an argument with a friend or loved one.
>
> Needing to get a lot completed in a short amount of time.
>
> Experiencing many small problems all at once, like getting in a
> traffic jam, spilling coffee all over yourself and running late.

**What** **are** **the** **complications** **of** **stress?**

Chronic stress can lead to many long-term health issues affecting your:

> [<u>Immune
> system</u>](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21196-immune-system)
> (like arthritis, fibromyalgia and psoriasis).
>
> [<u>Digestive
> system</u>](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system)
> (like weight gain or loss, ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome).
> [<u>Cardiovascular
> system</u>](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21833-cardiovascular-system)
> (like high blood pressure, increased heart rate and heart
> palpitations). [<u>Reproductive
> system</u>](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9118-female-reproductive-system)
> (like infections, polycystic ovarian syndrome and infertility).

Stress can also put you at a higher risk of developing a mental health
condition, like depression or anxiety. **If** **you’re** **feeling**

**How** **is** **stress** **diagnosed?**

Stress is subjective — not measurable with tests. Only the person
experiencing it can determine whether it’s present and how severe it
feels. A healthcare provider may use questionnaires to understand your
stress and how it affects your life.

If you have chronic stress, your healthcare provider can evaluate
symptoms that result from stress. For example, they can diagnose and
treat high blood pressure.

**Management** **and** **Treatment**

**How** **can** **I** **relieve** **stress?**

You can’t avoid stress. But you can stop it from becoming overwhelming
by practicing some daily

>
> At the end of each day, take a moment to think about what you’ve

>
> Set goals for your day, week and month. Narrowing your view can help

>
> Consider talking to a therapist or a healthcare provider about your
> worries.

**Prevention**

**How** **can** **I** **prevent** **or** **reduce** **stress?**

Many daily strategies can help you keep stress at bay:

**A** **note** **from** **Cleveland** **Clinic**

It’s natural to have stress sometimes. You slept in, your shirt’s
wrinkly and you’re going to be late for that job interview — now, you
feel stressed. But long-term stress can cause physical, emotional and
behavioral symptoms. It’s important to get control over your chronic
stress because it can lead to other health issues. If symptoms of stress
aren’t going away with stress relief techniques and if you’re feeling
overwhelmed, talk to a healthcare provider.
